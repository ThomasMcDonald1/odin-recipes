        <h3>All about Steak!</h3>
        <p>I'm sure most of us enjoy a nice and juicy steak, grilled or pan friend to perfection!</p>
        <p>The earliest written usage of the word 'steak' comes from the Nordic countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Findland.</p>
        <p>"Steik", "stickna", and "steikja" all refer to the thick slice of meat, whether it be from a cow or a tuna fish.</p>
        <p>Steaks are usually a cut from the hindquarter muscles of an animal that is either grilled, fried, or roasted.</p>
        <p>A particular 15th-century cookbook used the word "stekys" to describe the same cut of meat particularly from a cow, deer or elk.</p>
        <p>Information source: <a href="https://cattlemensrestaurant.com/history-of-steak#:~:text=The%20Origin%20of%20Steak&text=There%20is%20historical%20documentation%20from,fried%2C%20or%20roasted%20as%20preferred.">Cattlemen's Steakhouse</a></p>
        <p>However, today when we hear the word "steak", it is typically associated with meat from cattle. Today I will be sharing a recipe derived from this particular mammal.</p>

        <h3>How to Pan Sear a Steak:</h3>
        <p>Whichever steak you prefer, this recipe should do it justice. Particularly thicker-cuts of steak with a nice marbling of fat should work best such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New York Strip Steak</li>
            <li>Ribeye Steak</li>
            <li>Sirloin Steak</li>
            <li>Wagyu Steak(Very expensive thought!)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ingredients/Equipment Needed for this Recipe:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt Grinder with Salt</li>
            <li>Peppercorn Grinder with Peppercorns</li>
            <li>1/2 Tablespoon of Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>Rosemary Sprigs</li>
            <li>3-4 Chopped Cloves of Garlic</li>
            <li>Worcestershire Sauce</li>
            <li>Tongs</li>
            <li>Frying Pan</li>
            <li>A Knife</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We'll start off by pat drying our steak in order to get a great sear and prevent oil from splattering! Use a paper towel or dry cloth to accomplish this.</li>
            <li>Next, we'll season our steak with a generous amount of the ground salt and pepper. Searing the steak will mute the pepper a bit, so it's okay to add a little extra.</li>
            <li>Preheat the pan on the stove on medium heat and spread the olive oil around the pan.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking the Steak</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gently place the steaks on the heated pan, and try not to move it around in order to provide a nice desired seared crust</li>
            <li>For a rarer steak, we'll sear each side for about 2 minutes on a hotter temperature and then flip. For a more medium steak, sear each side for 3-4 minutes instead on a slightly lowered heat to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Using tongs, we'll flip the steak on each of its sides for about 1 minute per edge</li>
            <li>Turn the heat on low and add the butter, worcestershire sauce, chopped garlic, and a few rosemary sprigs and cover the pan with a lid.</li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes, turn the heat off and remove the steaks after another 5 minutes has passed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Enjoying your Steak</h3>
        <p>Once your steak has been removed and cooled, place the steak on a cutting board and slice the steak against the grain.</p>
        <p>The grain of the steak are the parallel fibers that are visible on the surface on the steak. It will be more tender to bite into when sliced perpendicular to these grains.</p>
        <p>Place the sliced steak on a plate, and drizzle the remainder sauce, garlic, and rosemary from the pan on the finished steak.</p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
