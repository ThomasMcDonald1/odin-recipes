        <img src="../images/pizza.jpg" alt="A tasty-looking pizza!">
        <h3>History and Description of this Recipe:</h3>
        <p>Pizza was first created in Naples, Italy. The earliest name of this dish was documented around AD 997 in Gaeta.</p>
        <p>The best pizzas have a crispy, bread crust, cheesy surface and tomato-based sauce. If you haven't tried pizza before, be sure to read on and make it yourself!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients needed to make pizza:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 3/5 cups of All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons of Dry Yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of Warm Water (not too hot or it will kill the yeast!)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of ground salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of sugar</li>
            <li>Tomato Sauce (store bought, unless you find another recipe to make it!)</li>
            <li>Firm mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Toppings of your choice (Pepperoni, mushroom, garlic; The sky's the limit!)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to make your pizza:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h5>Proof the yeast:</h5>
                <p>Place the warm water in a large bowl and sprinkle in the yeast until dissolved.</p>
                <p>After a few minutes, you should notice a beige-colored foam around the surface of the mixture. This means the yeast are alive and active!</p>
                <p>If you do not see the foaming/bloom of the mixture, this means your yeast is either expired or dead (heat can kill yeast) and you may either want to try again or buy new yeast!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Now that you have your bloomed yeast-water mixture, you can proceed to making the dough.</h5>
                <p>Add the flour, sugar, salt, and olive oil and mix with either your hands or a mixing paddle.</p>
                <p>You'll know the mixture is finished once everything is uniform and a bit sticky. (no clumps should remain)</p>
                <p>If the mixture is too tough to move with your hands, add a bit more water.</p>
                <p>If the mixture is too watery, add a bit more flour.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Let the Dough Rise</h5>
                <p>Spread a thin amount of oil around a large bowl and place the dough you made within it. Cover the bowl with cling wrap and let it sit in room temperature for about an hour and a half (70-80 degrees Fahrenheight).</p>
                <p>This allows the yeast a bit of time to ferment and rises the dough.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Knead a stretch your dough</h5>
                <p>After your dough is finished rising, we can make 2 medium-sized pizzas! So divide your dough in 2 equal portions and make them round. Save the other for later, or repeat these steps to make 2 pizzas!</p>
                <p>Flatten/stretch the dough out until it is about half an inch thick all around.</p>
                <p>Place the flattened dough on a cooking surface (such as a cooking sheet with foil)</p>
                <p>Preheat your over to 475 degrees Fahrenheight, and we can begin placing toppings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Adding toppings</h5>
                <p>Now that your dough is placed on a cooking surface, you'll begin adding toppings.</p>
                <p>
                    First:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add a thin-layer of pizza sauce, but leave room for the outer crust</li>
                        <li>Next, add the shredded mozarella cheese on top of the sauce enough to cover it up. Still leave room for the outer crust!</li>
                        <li>Finally, add whatever toppings you like over the cheese! I tend to add pepperoni, onion, garlic, and mushrooms.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, if you want your pizza to have more flavor, you can add italian seasoning spices with ground salt and peppercorn</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Cooking your pizza</h5>
                <p>Now that our pizza has all its topping, it's time to cook!</p>
                <p>Place your pizza on the center rack of your pre-heated oven. It should be 475 degrees Fahrenheight!</p>
                <p>Close the over, and let it cook for about 12-15 minutes depending on how crispy and crunchy you want your crust!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Enjoying your cooked pizza</h5>
                <p>After the pizza has finished cooking, take it out the over and let it cool for about 7 minutes.</p>
                <p>Cut the pizza in slices using a pizza cutter, grab some slices, and enjoy!</p> 
            </li>
        </ol>
